## Installation 
Before installing, please make sure you have node.js installed locally. If you don't already have node.js, you can download it via their website. After cloning this repo, open the integrated terminal in VS Code & install the npm inquirer package. A package.json file already exists with listed dependencies, so you can simply enter "npm install" to acquire the package.

---

## Usage
Once you've installed the required dependencies, run the application by entering "node index.js" into the integrated terminal. You'll then be prompted to enter the team manager's name & information. Once you've answered all the manager prompts, you'll have the option to add an engineer or an intern to your team, or complete your team setup. You can add as many engineers & interns as you'd like. When all team members are entered, select "my team is complete" to generate your html page.
